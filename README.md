# BaDonkey-Kong
Third-person action-adventure platformer game

Clarence the Robot wakes up trapped inside a large metal room. He sees strange monsters all around him, a locked door, and a wall he can climb. He must explore to find his way out!

Created in Unity3D for Game Design class. Our team of three included Clark Chambers, Molly Sulcer, and me.
